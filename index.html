    <h1>Recam치n Sequence</h1>
    <p id="sequence">0, 1, 3, 6, 2, 7, 13, 20, 12, 21, ...</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>Recam치n Sequence is an integer sequence. It's particularly beautiful and interesting in terms of strange balance between order and chaos. There are two ways of discovernig the balance. The first one is to try to visualize it and the second one is to try to create an audio version of the sequence.</p>

    <h2>Visualization</h2>
    <p>Let's say we have a counter. It's going to start at 1 and then go up (1, 2, 3, ...). For every counter value we're going to try to go backwards by couter value steps. If the spot is taken or there are no numbers backwards, we go forward.</p>
    
    <div>
        <p>So, we start at 0 with counter value = 1. We're trying to go backwards, and... Oh, no!!! There are no numbers in the sequence :( But we   don't give up and go to 1.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <p>Now we're trying to go backwards by 2. Unfortunately, we can't. So, we go forward by 2 and land on 3.</p>
        <div class="animation">
            <img class="animation" src="animations/2.gif">
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <p>Now we want to go backwards by 3. But the spot is taken :^( So we have no alternative but to go to 6.</p>
        <div class="animation">
            <img class="animation" src="animations/3.gif">
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <p>Far from losing hope, we should face the challenges and try to go backwards by 4. And yay! The spot is open, so we land on 2.</p>
        <div class="animation">
            <img class="animation" src="animations/4.gif">
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <p>Now we try to go backwards by 5. Well, we can't, so we go to 7.</p>
        <div class="animation">
            <img class="animation" src="animations/5.gif">

    <p>Let's see the visualization of Recam치n Sequence and the audio interpretation!</p>

        This visualization was made using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/"> tutorials by Daniel Shiffman</a> and inspired by <a href="https://youtu.be/FGC5TdIiT9U">Numberphile's video</a> about the sequence.
