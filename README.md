An explorable explanation of the Recam√°n Sequence made for the [Explorable Explanation Jam](

Check out [Numberphile YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/FGC5TdIiT9U) to discover more about the interpretation and the sequence.

I also used p5.js library tutorials by Daniel Shiffman. You can find the tutorials on [Daniel's YouTube channel]( http://youtube.com/thecodingtrain)
